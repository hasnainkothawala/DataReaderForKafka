# DataReaderForKafka

In this project, the idea is to write a python script that can run on a linux server, read each row from the csv file and 
convert it to JSON message and then publish it on the console. This is need when you want to simulate a real time big data ecosystem which also
has a PUSH - SUBSCRIBE messaging system such as KAFKA on it. We can configure the velocity at which we want to push messages to the console.
